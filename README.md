  ## Introduction
   **Full Tutorial In My Blog:** [click here](https://www.hoseinh.com/how-to-create-a-count-down-timer-in-react-easily/)
  reactjs-countdown-hook is a simple count down timer hook for react that makes creating timers very easy this hook is very flexible and it accepts seconds and a function to run after the count down is over and it features formatted seconds, minutes, hours and days and it has functions for pausing, resuming and resetting.

## Installation

  

```bash

npm install --save reactjs-countdown-hook

```

  

## Usage
the useTimer hook of "reactjs-countdown-hook" accepts initial remaining time as seconds and an optional callback function to run when the timer is over and the hook returns the following variables:

 - isActive: the state of the timer that shows if the count down is paused or it's active - boolean
 - counter: remaining time in seconds - number
 - seconds: 00 formatted remaining seconds - string
 - minutes: 00 formatted remaining minutes - string 
 - hours: 00 formatted remaining hours - string
 - days: 00 formatted remaining days - string
 - pause:  a function to pause the count down - function
 - resume:  a function to resume the count down - function
 - reset:  a function to reset the count down to the given initial seconds - function

in the below example I have created a simple timer with 2 minutes initial remaining time and it alerts "times up!" when the count down is over:
```jsx

import { useTimer } from  "reactjs-countdown-hook";

const  Example = () => {

const {
isActive,
counter,
seconds,
minutes,
hours,
days,
pause,
resume,
reset,
} = useTimer(120, handleTimerFinish);

function  handleTimerFinish() {
	alert("times up!");
}

return (
<div>

	<div>{`${days} : ${hours} : ${minutes} : ${seconds}`}</div>
	<button  onClick={() => (isActive ? pause() : resume())}>
		{isActive ? "Pause" : "Resume"}
	</button>
	<button  onClick={reset}>Reset</button>

</div>

);

};

```
